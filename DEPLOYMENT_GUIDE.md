# Remote Server Deployment: Issues and Solutions

This document outlines potential issues when deploying the script on a remote server and provides solutions to mitigate them.

---

## 1. Website Inaccessibility or Request Blocking
- **Issue:** The OKX website may block frequent requests or be temporarily unavailable.
- **Solutions:**
  - Add delays between requests (e.g., `time.sleep()`).
  - Handle HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) with exponential backoff retry mechanisms.
  - Use proxies or IP rotation to distribute requests across multiple addresses.

---

## 2. HTML Structure Changes
- **Issue:** Changes in the OKX website's HTML structure may break parsing logic.
- **Solutions:**
  - Use specific CSS selectors or XPath for extracting announcement links.
  - Implement exception handling for parsing errors.
  - Set up alerts/logging to notify about unexpected structure changes.

---

## 3. Filesystem Issues
- **Issue:** Lack of write permissions or insufficient disk space on the server may cause failures.
- **Solutions:**
  - Ensure folders exist and have appropriate write permissions using `os.makedirs(folder, exist_ok=True)`.
  - Check available disk space before saving files.
  - Regularly clean up temporary or redundant files.

---

## 4. Encoding and Character Handling
- **Issue:** Special characters in announcements may cause encoding errors during file operations.
- **Solutions:**
  - Use UTF-8 encoding for all file reads and writes.
  - Handle encoding errors with fallback mechanisms.

---

## 5. Unreliable Network Connections
- **Issue:** Network timeouts or intermittent failures can disrupt the script.
- **Solutions:**
  - Set timeouts for HTTP requests (`requests.get(..., timeout=10)`).
  - Implement retry logic for transient errors using `requests.exceptions`.
  - Log failed requests with error details for debugging.

---

## 6. Resource Optimization
- **Issue:** High resource usage can impact server performance.
- **Solutions:**
  - Limit concurrent requests using thread pools (e.g., `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`).
  - Avoid redundant requests by caching already processed links.

---

## 7. Monitoring and Logging
- **Issue:** Failures or issues may go unnoticed without proper logging or monitoring.
- **Solutions:**
  - Log all successes, errors, and warnings using a centralized logging mechanism.
  - Set up alerts for critical issues via email, Slack, or other messaging systems.

---

## 8. Dependency Management
- **Issue:** Missing or inconsistent dependencies may cause runtime errors.
- **Solutions:**
  - Provide a `requirements.txt` file with all Python dependencies.
  - Use virtual environments (`venv`) or Docker to ensure consistent environments.

---

## 9. Security Concerns
- **Issue:** Potential vulnerabilities in file handling or unauthorized access to saved data.
- **Solutions:**
  - Use HTTPS for all requests to the OKX website.
  - Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal attacks using the `sanitize_filename` utility.
  - Restrict access to the save directory and enforce strict file permissions.

---

## 10. Localization and Multi-language Support
- **Issue:** Announcements may appear in multiple languages or localized formats.
- **Solutions:**
  - Ensure the parsing logic supports multi-language content.
  - Test the script on different language versions of the OKX website.

---

## 11. Temporary Downtime Management
- **Issue:** Website outages or server reboots may disrupt the script.
- **Solutions:**
  - Use task schedulers like `cron` or `systemd` to retry tasks periodically.
  - Save the state of processed announcements to allow resumption after failures.

---

## 12. HTML Parsing Reliability
- **Issue:** Incomplete or malformed HTML can lead to parsing errors.
- **Solutions:**
  - Handle edge cases and validate parsed data (e.g., links and titles) before processing.
  - Log parsing issues for further analysis.

---

## 13. Rate Limits and Load Management
- **Issue:** Exceeding request rate limits can lead to blocks or errors.
- **Solutions:**
  - Add configurable delays between requests to respect rate limits.
  - Use distributed systems or load balancers for scaling large workloads.
